On a journey along paths of concrete and steel, over waters where the horizon meets the goal. Stretch long, stretch wide, over the song of the waves, which bridge is this, where the journey took its course?

Look towards the pillars, see the lines that lead you straight, across the gap that separates water from the mainland's net. In the 'RoadTrip' challenge, you must know and see, what is the name of the bridge you cross, where does it take you with?

It binds land to land, and coast to coast, provides travelers a path, on their own wanderlust. So the name of this structure, so tall and so free, can you solve this riddle, and bring the answer back to me?
